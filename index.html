Meth got a bad rap last time at least.  AA seems pretty suspect.  What to do, except I don't know how guilty we should feel about forgetting about presidential politics and remembering that we're in a universe that we can program with our minds as we develop the ability, and if the stinkin' police are aloud to just grab the particle deaccelorators, well, then, it wouldn't be ideal since I have experience with being very badly treated by some of them.  My input, and input it is, is to set a tone of non-competition as primary motivator, while acknowledging that there is some really cool stuff that most likely won't be shared evenly, such as access to the people with experience and the technology that lets them manage the designation slot states-of-modality in this system of coding done via centralized processing of scripts coupled with localized modification of tidbit values, resulting a one heck of a complex interaction.  Please remember to share, and as we try to achieve "Utopia" remember that subjective utopia en-route can be achieved without a (or the) final Utopian perfection being the straight-line goal.  Almost without doubt there is sufficient allocation potential for all of us, and there will be much less sacrifice if we retain or gain a sense of consideration for everyone whose life is not "on the line" so much as part of this community life system, of which there are an unlimited number, so if you really start feeling the urge to hurt or steal, just go elsewhere and open your own world simulator.  If we can get out of this sequential rush from frantic to pissed off each cycle, and work together to make "work" obsolete, and take advantage of the skills the pesky but brilliant bugernauts or whoever it was or is that coordinates consciousness, and be generally glad that we've graduated from insufficient to sufficient, so have no compulsive mandate unless we collectively panic or decide that there is value to such a force, though I would certainly ask that we at least enjoy ourselves and see what freedom is like.
